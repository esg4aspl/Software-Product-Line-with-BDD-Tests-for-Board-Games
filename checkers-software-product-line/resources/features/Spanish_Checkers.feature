    When the players start the game
    Then the player with the "light" colored pieces is given the turn

  Scenario Outline: Valid Regular Move (2) (<hiptest-uid>)
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks a valid source coordinate that has a "<piece_type>" piece in it
    And the player picks a valid destination coordinate that is "one" squares away from the source coordinate
    Then the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the next turn is given to the "next ingame" player
