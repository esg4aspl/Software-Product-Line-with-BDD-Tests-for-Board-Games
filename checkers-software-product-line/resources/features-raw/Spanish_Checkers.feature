  Scenario Outline: Valid Regular Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player makes a "valid regular" move
    Then the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the next turn is given to the "next ingame" player

      | validRegularMove8 | queen      | f: queen can jump multiple squares without capturing                         |

  Scenario Outline: Valid Jump Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player makes a "valid capture" move
    Then the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the captured opponent piece is removed from the board
    And the next turn is given to the "<next_turn_player>" player

  Scenario Outline: Invalid Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player makes a "invalid" move
    Then the piece is not moved
    And an error message is shown saying "<error_message>"
    And the player is asked for another move

  Scenario Outline: Crowning the Eligible Piece
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player makes a move to opponent's crownhead with a pawn
    Then the piece is "promoted" to a crowned piece
    And the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the next turn is given to the "next ingame" player
