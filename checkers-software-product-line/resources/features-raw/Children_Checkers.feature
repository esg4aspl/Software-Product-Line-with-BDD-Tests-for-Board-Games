Feature: Children Checkers

  Background: 
    Given the "Children Checkers" game is set up

  Scenario: Start of the Game
    When the players start the game
    Then the player with the dark-colored pieces is given the turn

  Scenario Outline: Valid Regular Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks a valid source coordinate that has a "<piece_type>" piece in it
    And the player picks a valid destination coordinate that is "one" squares away from the source coordinate
    Then the piece at the source coordinate is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the next turn is given to the "other" player

    Examples: 
      | file_name         | piece_type |
      | validRegularMove1 | pawn       |
      | validRegularMove2 | pawn       |
      | validRegularMove3 | pawn       |
      | validRegularMove4 | pawn       |
      | validRegularMove5 | pawn       |
      | validRegularMove6 | pawn  Â     |

  Scenario Outline: Valid Jump Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks a valid source coordinate that has a "<piece_type>" piece in it
    And the player picks a valid destination coordinate that is "two" squares away from the source coordinate
    Then the piece at the source coordinate is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the opponent piece in between the source and destination coordinates are removed from the board
    And the next turn is given to the "<next_turn_player>" player

    Examples: 
      | file_name       | next_turn_player | piece_type |
      | validJumpMove1  | other            | pawn       |

      | validJumpMove17 | other            | pawn       |

  Scenario Outline: Invalid Source Coordinate for Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks an invalid "source" coordinate because "<invalidity_reason>"
