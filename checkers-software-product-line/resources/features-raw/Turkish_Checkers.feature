Feature: Turkish Checkers

  Background: 
    Given the "Turkish Checkers" game is set up

  Scenario: Start of the Game
    When the players start the game
    Then the player with the "light" colored pieces is given the turn

  Scenario Outline: Valid Regular Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks a valid source coordinate that has a "<piece_type>" piece in it
    And the player picks a valid destination coordinate that is "one" squares away from the source coordinate
    Then the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the next turn is given to the "next ingame" player

    Examples:

      | validRegularMove4 | pawn       | f: opponent is not blocked, his king can jump backward, game should not end |
      | validRegularMove5 | pawn       | f: opponent is not blocked, his pawn can jump forward, game should not end  |
      | validRegularMove6 | pawn       | f: opponent is not blocked, his pawn can jump forward, game should not end  |
      | validRegularMove7 | king       | f: king can jump multiple squares without capturing                         |
      | validRegularMove8 | king       | f: king can jump multiple squares without capturing                         |

  Scenario Outline: Valid Jump Move
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks a valid source coordinate that has a "<piece_type>" piece in it
    And the player picks a valid destination coordinate that is "multiple" squares away from the source coordinate
    Then the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the opponent piece in between the source and destination coordinates are removed from the board
    And the next turn is given to the "<next_turn_player>" player

  Scenario Outline: Crowning the Eligible Piece
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    When the player picks a valid source coordinate that has a "pawn" piece in it
    And the player picks a valid destination coordinate in opponent's crownhead
    Then the piece is "<action>" to a crowned piece
    And the piece is moved to the destination coordinate
    And the next turn is given to the "<next_turn_player>" player

    #| crowningTheEligiblePiece5   | promoted | next ingame | f: jump move, adjacent vulnerable opponent pawn |
    #| crowningTheEligiblePiece5.1 | promoted | next ingame | f: jump move, far away vulnerable opponent pawn |

  Scenario Outline: Crowning The Eligible Piece - Capturing Kings in the Crownhead
    Given the game is played up to a certain point from file "<file_name>"
    And the player has a "pawn" piece in opponent's crownhead
    When the player jumps over all the vulnerable opponent kings in the crownhead
    Then the piece is "promoted" to a crowned piece
    And the next turn is given to the "next ingame" player

    Examples: 
      | file_name                                          | explanation                                                                                                                          |
      | crowningTheEligiblePieceCapturingKingsInCrownhead1 | f: pawn jumps one king, lands at a square where there is no adjacent piece, and becomes king                                         |
